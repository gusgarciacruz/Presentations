- Agglomeration economies presents important positive externalities (Glaeser, 1998; Duranton and Puga, 2004):
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
 - Reduction of transportation costs 
 - higher flow of information
 - Greater specialization and division of labor
 
- Diseconomies of agglomeration are the opposite (Da Schio et al., 2019):
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
 - Overcrowding
 - Congestion
 - Ecosystem degradation $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">air pollution 
 
- Air pollution has important negative effects on several socioeconomic variables:
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
 - Health (Cohen et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2022)
 - Education (Sunyer et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018)
 - Labor (Poudyal et al., 2013; He et al., 2019)
 - <span style="color:blue">Housing market</span> (Wang and Lee, 2022; Wang et al., 2022)
 
- Analyzing the effect of air pollution on the housing market is important for several reasons:
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
 - Property values: air pollution can negatively impact the desirability of neighborhoods
 - Health impacts: poor air quality is linked to various health issues, which can affect residents' quality of life
 - Urban planning: city planners and policymakers can use this analysis to promote sustainable development
 - Community awareness: highlighting the impact of air pollution on housing can raise public awareness

<span style="color:blue">Overall, understanding how air pollution affects the housing market is crucial for economic stability, public health, and effective urban planning

- Research on the effects of air pollution on the housing market is based on the theory of the Hedonic Price Method of Rosen (1974). <span style="color:blue">However, theoretical and empirical research has focused attention on objective measures of pollution, while subjective indicators based on people’s perceptions have received less attention

- Three relevant aspects justify the inclusion of subjective variables to estimate the impact of air quality on real estate markets:
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
 - Objective and subjective air quality measures are not strictly related (Berezansky et al., 2010)
 - Neighborhood halo effect (Brody et al., 2004)
 - The importance of subjective variables in assessing the impact of public policies on well-being (Kahneman et al., 1997)

- However, empirical evidence of hedonic pricing model estimates incorporating both objective and subjective indicators of air quality is very limited

- This paper contributes to the literature on the effects of environmental amenities on the housing market, <span style="color:blue">including subjective and objective metrics of air quality 

- Our contribution to the literature is twofold:
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em"> 
 - We propose a theoretical model of hedonic price where household preferences are affected by the neighborhood’s perception of air quality
 - We estimate a spatial hedonic model which includes an air quality index which allows for the interaction between objective and subjective measures of air quality

- Using data at the intra-urban level in Medellin (Colombia) on a sample of dwellings, we identified the effect of objective and subjective metrics of air pollution on housing market through <span style="color:blue">spatial hedonic models</span> correcting different possible causes of endogeneity

There are few papers in the literature that estimate spatial hedonic models that incorporate both objective and subjective indicators of air quality

- Chasco and Le Gallo (2013, 2015)
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
 - Madrid (Spain)
 - Objective indicator: several types of air pollutants $(SO_2$, $NO_x$, $NO_2$, $CO$, $PM)$
 - Subjective indicator: population’s perception of pollution
 - Spatial quantile and multilevel models
 - housing prices are better explained by subjective evaluation factors than by objective measurements

- Montero et al. (2018) 
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
 - Madrid (Spain)
 - Only included subjective indicator: population’s perception of pollution 
 - spatial parametric and semiparametric models
 - strong negative impacts of subjective evaluation of air pollution on housing market, but the characteristics of the neighborhood absorb a large part of the environmental impacts 
 
<span style="color:blue"> This paper aims to offer new evidence on the effects of environmental amenities on the housing market, including subjective and objective metrics of air quality in a spatial hedonic model in the context of a developing-country city

$$ log(Rental \text{ } price_i) = \alpha + \beta AP_i + \textbf{S}_i' \boldsymbol{\omega}_1 + \textbf{N}_j' \boldsymbol{\omega}_2 + \color{blue}{\gamma W Rental \text{ } price_i} +u_i$$

Estimating the proposed hedonic model may face two problems related to <span style="color:blue">endogeneity</span> due to (Anselin, 1988; Anselin and Lozano-Gracia, 2009):
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
- measurement errors in contamination levels by the interpolation and subjective responses

- the inclusion of spatially lagged dependent variable $(W Rental \text{ } price_i)$

To deal with these endogeneity problems, we use an <span style="color:blue">Instrumental Variable (IV) approach</span> (Chay and Greenstone, 2005; Bayer et al, 2006; Lee, 2006):
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
- we use the wind direction as an instrument for the measures of air pollution $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">air pollutions is affected by meteorological factors</span> (Deryugina et al., 2019; Bondy et al., 2020; Carneiro et al., 2021; Jon et al., 2023)

- endogeneity problem associated with the inclusion of a spatial lag in the models is corrected including spatial lags of a superior order of control variables (Kelejian and Robinson, 1993; Kelejian and Prucha, 1998; Fingleton and Le Gallo, 2008). $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">spatial lags of order 2</span> (López et al., 2020)

We use <span style="color:blue">spatial two-stage least squares (S2SLS)</span> to estimate the models and use a robust heteroskedastic estimator to correct standard errors

- In general, <span style="color:blue">the results show that air pollution present a negative and significant effect on housing rental price

- When spatial dependence is consider in different structures, <span style="color:blue">subjective air pollution measure shows a larger negative effect on housing market compared to the effect of objective metric</span>, and the magnitude of the effect is amplified with the interaction of the subjective and objective variables

- The estimated direct effects of air pollution on housing market confirm our previous findings that <span style="color:blue">housing rental prices are more affected by subjective evaluation factors than by objective measurements

- <span style="color:blue">The indirect effect (or spillover effect) of air pollution on housing rental prices is also negative and statistically significant</span>, indicating that the rental price of one dwelling is affected by the level of air pollution of neighboring dwelling 

- These results confirm that housing decisions are <span style="color:blue">subject to perceptions of place</span> and it is important to consider the <span style="color:blue">spillover effects of air pollution on housing market
