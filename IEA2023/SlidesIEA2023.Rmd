- Despite the extensive literature on both housing informality and labor informality, <span style="color:blue">there is a lack of evidence on the relationship between these two phenomena in space</span>

- This paper aims to offer <span style="color:blue">new evidence on the links between precarious housing conditions (informal housing) and limited access to quality employment (labor informality), considering the relationship and spatial dimension of these two phenomena</span>

- Using data at the intra-urban level in Medellin (Colombia), we identified the effect of labor informality on housing informality through <span style="color:blue">spatial simultaneous equation models</span>, which take into account the relationship between informal housing and labor informality and the spatial dependence

Estimating the proposed system of equations may face two problems related to <span style="color:blue">endogeneity</span> (Le Gallo and Fingleton, 2021):

- including endogenous variables as regressors, that is, the inclusion of the dependent variable from the second equation (labor informality) in the first equation and the inclusion of the dependent variable from the first equation (housing informality) in the second equation

- including a spatial lag in the model

To deal with these endogeneity problems, we use an <span style="color:blue">Instrumental Variable (IV) approach:
- we use the Euclidean distance (in km) from the centroids of each analytical region to Medellín’s Central Business District (CBD) as an instrument for the labor informality variable $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">spatial mismatch hypothesis</span>

- we use the level of housing informality lagged in time (2011) as an instrument for the current housing informality $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">temporal inertia of housing informality 

- endogeneity problem associated with the inclusion of a spatial lag in the models is corrected including spatial lags of a superior order of control variables (Kelejian and Robinson, 1993; Kelejian and Prucha, 1998; Fingleton and Le Gallo, 2008). $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">spatial lags of order 2</span> (López et al., 2020)

Another methodological aspect to be considered in estimating the proposed system of spatial simultaneous equations is <span style="color:blue">the presence of cross-equation correlations in the error terms</span> $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue"> informal transport

- In summary, our model is a <span style="color:blue">system of spatial simultaneous equations that allows for correlation between the errors of the equations 

- We use the <span style="color:blue">Generalized Spatial Three-Stage Least Square (GS3SLS) estimator</span> proposed by Kelejian and Prucha (2004) to estimate this model 

- This procedure first corrects the endogeneity problem using a two-stage estimator, namely the GS2SLS method. Then, it considers the relationship between the equations in the system through the stochastic disturbances analogous to a <span style="color:blue">Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR)

<spam style="font-size:120%">

- <span style="color:blue">Urban informality is a persistent phenomenon in developing countries</span> and it is an important factor affecting the productivity and wellbeing of cities
    
- In this study we analyze the relationship between informal housing and labor informality at the intra-urban level in Medellín (Colombia), taking into account the spatial dimension of these two phenomena
    
- From a point of view of the location of the urban informality, we found:
<p style="margin-bottom: -1em">
  - Urban informality is located in <span style="color:blue">poor peripheral areas</span>
  - There is a <span style="color:blue">spatial simultaneity</span> between housing informality and labor informality
  - Housing informality and labor informality are phenomena with a <span style="color:blue">high spatial persistence
    
- The estimates of the spatial simultaneous equation models showed that labor informality positively affects housing informality $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">precarious labor conditions are important factors that explain the choice of precarious housing
    
- Additionally, there are not spatial spillover effects of labor informality on informal housing $\Longrightarrow$ <span style="color:blue">This may suggest a highly localized relationship between informal housing and labor informality due to the peculiarities of the informal work carried out within homes, leading to precarious housing conditions
